# UnrealBridge — engine version compatibility

The plugin compiles against **Unreal Engine 5.4** and **5.7**. Some features
are gated to 5.7+ because they depend on engine APIs that don't exist or
behave differently on 5.4.

This document lists what's gated. The build matrix in `tools/build_matrix.py`
verifies the gates by compiling the plugin against each engine version.

## Whole-library gates (disappear entirely on 5.4)

Each library below is wrapped in `#if !UE_VERSION_OLDER_THAN(5, 7, 0)`. On 5.4
its `.h` and `.cpp` compile to empty translation units, no `UCLASS` is
registered, and calling any of its UFUNCTIONs from Python on a 5.4 build will
fail with "no such function on UnrealBridgeXxxLibrary".

| Library | Reason |
|---|---|
| `UnrealBridgeChooserLibrary` | `OutputObjectColumn.h` doesn't exist in 5.4 (added with the Chooser plugin's output-column rewrite); other Chooser internals shifted heavily 5.4 → 5.7 |
| `UnrealBridgePoseSearchLibrary` | Core API rewritten: `UPoseSearchSchema::GetRoledSkeletons`, `UPoseSearchDatabase::GetNumAnimationAssets` / `GetDatabaseAnimationAsset`, and `FPoseSearchDatabaseAnimationAsset` are all 5.5+ additions |
| `UnrealBridgeMaterialLibrary` | `EMaterialDomain::MD_*` enum values differ in scope; `MATUSAGE_Voxels` / `MATUSAGE_StaticMesh` don't exist in 5.4 |
| `UnrealBridgeNavigationLibrary` | `ARecastNavMesh::GetDebugGeometryForTile` 2nd arg type changed (`int32` → `FNavTileRef`) and the "default tile = aggregate all" sentinel doesn't exist on 5.4 |

## Single-UFUNCTION gates (library still works, one function unavailable on 5.4)

| UFUNCTION | Reason |
|---|---|
| `UnrealBridgeDataTableLibrary::CopyDataTableRows` | `UDataTable::AddRow(FName, const uint8*, UScriptStruct*)` 3-arg overload is 5.7+ |
| `UnrealBridgeBlueprintLibrary::AddAsyncActionNode` | `UK2Node_AsyncAction::InitializeProxyFromFunction` doesn't exist on 5.4 |
| `UnrealBridgeGameplayAbilityLibrary::AddAbilityTaskNode` | `UK2Node_LatentAbilityCall` UCLASS in `GameplayAbilitiesEditor` is non-API in 5.4; `NewObject<>` of it fails to link from external modules |

## Inline shims (function works on both, different code paths)

These remain callable on 5.4 — the macro picks the right code path internally.

| Function | What 5.4 lacks | Shim |
|---|---|---|
| `UnrealBridgeAnimLibrary::SetAnimStateDefault` | `UAnimStateEntryNode::GetOutputPin()` | walk `Entry->Pins[]` for the first `EGPD_Output` pin |
| `UnrealBridgeGameplayAbilityLibrary::GetGameplayAbilityBlueprintInfo` and `ListGameplayAbilitiesByTag` | `UGameplayAbility::GetAssetTags()` | read legacy `CDO->AbilityTags` field |
| `UnrealBridgeBlueprintLibrary::GetPIENodeCoverage` | `FKismetDebugUtilities::FindSourceNodeForCodeLocation` const-correctness | `const_cast<UFunction*>(Func)` |

## How the gate macro works

```cpp
#include "Misc/EngineVersionComparison.h"

#if !UE_VERSION_OLDER_THAN(5, 7, 0)
// only compiled on 5.7+
#endif
```

The threshold is **5.7.0** uniformly because that's the highest version we
have validated. We have not yet tested 5.5 or 5.6 — some APIs currently
gated as "5.7+" likely work on 5.5 or 5.6 too, but until the matrix proves
it, we use the conservative cutoff.

## Verifying

```
python tools/build_matrix.py             # build against all configured engines
python tools/build_matrix.py --only 5.4  # only 5.4
python tools/build_matrix.py --only 5.7  # only 5.7
```

Last verified versions:
- UE 5.4.4 (J:\UnrealEngine\UE_5.4) — 5.4-Plus stable build
- UE 5.7.1 (G:\UnrealEngine\UE_5.7) — 5.7.1-48512491

## Lowering the threshold (when adding 5.5 / 5.6)

When you install 5.5 or 5.6 and add it to `tools/engines.local.json`,
re-running the matrix will reveal which of the 5.7-gated items also work on
the new version. To lower a gate from 5.7 to 5.5:

1. Replace `UE_VERSION_OLDER_THAN(5, 7, 0)` with `UE_VERSION_OLDER_THAN(5, 5, 0)`
   on the affected sites.
2. Re-run the matrix; verify the lowered version passes.
3. Update this table.
